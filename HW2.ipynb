        "1.   Make sure you're using tensorboard to keep track of the discriminator AND generator losses throughout. Note that if your discriminator loss goes to 0, this represents a failure mode of your training (look at how the generator loss function is calculated and you realize that G's gradients vanish).\n",
        "2.   Keep vigilant for mode collapse. Display your image after every delta number of iterations to see that not only is your image getting better, but you're also not getting the same image each time. If so, then your network is suffering from mode collapse.\n",
        "3.   Analyze your generator loss and make sure that it's roughly oscillating around a certain loss. Unlike most other tasks, your generator and discriminator loss are NOT intended to monotonically decrease. Instead they should bounce around a certain loss (see image below for example). Your graph doesn't have to look like this but this is meant to illustrate how the loss should roughly bounce around a certain loss.\n",
